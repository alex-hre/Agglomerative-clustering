# Clusterizer

This program implements the generation of random points in two-dimensional space, clustering using agglomerative cluster analysis, cluster evaluation and visualization.


## About the Project
The goal of this project was to develop the most efficient code for agglomerative clustering of points and finding their center points.


## How to use
1) Download the project
2) Run main. Further instructions will be displayed on the screen.


## Documentation
Details about how the code works and how to use the program are in the documentation and also in comments inside the code.. (Ignore the design details as this was a class project)
